2. Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8083/feedback to view any feedback objects you may have
3. Go the folder 'frontendCode' and run the index.html file. Go to the localhost (Easy to use through VSCode) and you'll see the feedback form.
4. Input a String description and a Number rating, then press Submit!
5. You can go to http://localhost:8083/feedback to see you're newly added feedback object

- Create a REST controller class to create the REST endpoint. It should take in - parameters using the POST protocol
- Data received in the REST controller will be then saved into the database
- Create a test form in HTML to submit data to the REST endpoint to ensure itâ€™s - working
- The step-by-step process involved in completing this task should be documented
